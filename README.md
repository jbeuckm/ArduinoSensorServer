### Arduino HTTP Server ###

This is meant to build out a more complete REST type HTTP server for arduino + ethernet shield. Currently, the output is JSON and support is added for reporting the output of a DHT temp/humidity sensor connected to pin 2.

#### Dependencies ####

* An ethernet shield and the included Ethernet library as in the WebServer example
* The DHT module library as mentioned [here](http://www.hobbyist.co.nz/?q=documentations/wiring-up-dht11-temp-humidity-sensor-to-your-arduino).
